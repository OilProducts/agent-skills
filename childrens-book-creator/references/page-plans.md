# Picture book page planning (practical)

Picture books are designed around page turns and spreads. When in doubt, plan by **spread** (two facing pages) rather than by single page.

## 32-page print reality (common, varies by publisher)
There is usually front/back matter (endpapers, title/copyright). The **story pages** often fit roughly **12–14 spreads**.

## Spread plan template (copy/paste)

Use a table like this in `page_plan.md`:

| Spread | Goal (what changes) | Text (draft) | Illustration must show | Page-turn hook |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Setup: character + want |  |  |  |
| 2 | Problem appears |  |  |  |
| 3 | Attempt #1 |  |  |  |
| 4 | Attempt #2 (bigger) |  |  |  |
| 5 | Attempt #3 (rule of 3) |  |  |  |
| 6 | Complication |  |  |  |
| 7 | Lowest point |  |  |  |
| 8 | Twist / new idea |  |  |  |
| 9 | Plan in action |  |  |  |
| 10 | Payoff moment |  |  |  |
| 11 | Resolution |  |  |  |
| 12 | Cozy landing / final joke |  |  |  |

If the story needs more room, expand to 14 spreads; if it’s very tight, compress to 10–12.

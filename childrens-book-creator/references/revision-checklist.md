# Revision checklist (fast, practical)

Use in `revision_notes.md` and do 2–3 focused passes.

## Pass 1: Structure + clarity
- Premise is clear in the first 1–2 spreads/pages
- “Want” and obstacle are understandable to the target age
- Escalation is real (attempts get harder/funnier)
- Ending pays off the promise (laugh/comfort/wonder)
- Visual story and text agree (no missing info)

## Pass 2: Language + read-aloud
- Sentences are short and easy to say out loud
- Verbs are concrete (“dash”, “squeeze”, “wiggle”) rather than abstract
- Repetition is intentional (refrain, pattern, rule-of-3)
- Every line earns its place; remove throat-clearing

## Pass 3: Audience + sensitivity
- No stereotypes; characters have agency and dignity
- “Lesson” is not scolding; it emerges from action
- Fear/sadness is resolved safely for the age group
- Avoid accidental cruelty (jokes at a character’s expense)
